An injured John Isner may be out of commission for next week’s Laver Cup, but Team World could receive the big boost it needs from his replacement.

Coming off his biggest major result, Frances Tiafoe has been named as Isner’s replacement for the team competition taking place at London’s O2 Arena. Big Foe ousted Rafael Nadal on his way to the semifinals of the US Open, where he narrowly lost to eventual title holder Carlos Alcaraz in an electric five-set affair.

US Open semifinalist Frances Tiafoe returns for a third Laver Cup with Team World when play gets underway at The O2 in London on Friday, September 23.

Tiafoe is no stranger to Laver Cup, having played the inaugural match five years ago in Prague against Team Europe’s Marin Cilic. The 24-year-old will hope to carry over momentum from New York, as his squad is yet to lift the trophy in its first four attempts.

“It’s an incredible event and I hope I can win points for Team World in London this time. I know what to expect and I think we have a great chance this year of taking the title from Team Europe,” he said in a statement.

Ranked a career-high No. 19 as a result of his Queens run, Tiafoe joins compatriots Taylor Fritz and Jack Sock, Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime, Argentina’s Diego Schwartzman and Australia’s Alex de Minaur. He also participated in 2018 when Chicago hosted.

The event will take place from September 23-25.
