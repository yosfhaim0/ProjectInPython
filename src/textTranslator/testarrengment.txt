Google CEO Sundar Pichai, speaking at the Code Conference last week, suggested the tech company needed to become 20% more efficient — a comment some in the industry took to mean headcount= ספירת ראשים reductions could soon be on the table. Now, it seems that prediction= נְבוּאָה may be coming= מגיע true. TechCrunch has learned, and Google confirmed, the company is slashing= שׁוֹצֵף projects at its in-house= פנים R&D division known as Area 120.The company on Tuesday informed staff of a “reduction in force” that will see the incubator= מַדגֵרָה halved= חָצוּי in size, as half the teams working on new product innovations= חידושים heard their projects were being canceled. Previously, there were 14 projects housed in Area 120, and this has been cut down to just seven. Employees whose projects will not continue were told they’ll need to find a new job within Google by the end of January 2023, or they’ll be terminated.= הופסק It’s not clear that everyone will be able to do so.According to Area 120 lead Elias Roman, the division aims to sharpen= לְחַדֵד its focus to only AI-first projects, as opposed to its earlier= מוקדם יותר mandate= מַנדָט to fuel product incubation= דְגִירָה across all of Google.TechCrunch learned of the changes from a source with knowledge of the matter. Google confirmed the changes in a statement.“Area 120 is an in-house incubator for experimental= נִסיוֹנִי new products. The group regularly starts and stops projects with an eye toward pursuing= רודף the most promising= מַבְטִיחַ opportunities,”= הזדמנויות a Google spokesperson= דובר said. “We’ve recently shared that Area 120 will be shifting its focus to projects that build on Google’s deep investment in AI and have the potential to solve important user problems. As a result, Area 120 is winding down several projects to make way for new work. Impacted team members will receive dedicated= מוּקדָשׁ support as they explore new projects and opportunities= הזדמנויות at Google.”Over the years, the division has launched a number of successful products, including the HTML5 gaming= משחק platform GameSnacks, now integrated= מְשׁוּלָב with Google Chrome; an AirTable rival called Tables which exited to Google Cloud; an AI-powered conversational= שיחה ads platform AdLingo, which also exited to Cloud; video platforms Tangi and Shoploop, which exited to Google Search and Shopping, respectively;= בהתאמה the web-based= מבוסס רשת travel app= אפליקציה Touring Bird, which exited to Commerce; and a technical interview platform Byteboard, a rare external spinout.One= ספין of the projects now being cut with the changes is Qaya, a service offering web storefronts= חזית חנות for digital creators,= יוצרים launched late last year. Similar to “link in bio”= ביו solutions available today like Linktree or Beacons, Qaya additionally= בנוסף integrated with Google Search and Google Shopping. It could also be linked with a YouTube Merch Shelf, to promote the creator’s= בורא products and services.The other six projects being canceled weren’t yet launched but included a financial accounting project for Google Sheets, another shopping-related= קשורים לקניות product, analytics= ניתוח for AR/VR, and, unfortunately, three climate-related= קשור לאקלים projects. These latter projects had focused on EV car-charging= טעינת רכב maps with routing,= ניתוב carbon accounting for IT and carbon measurement of forests.The changes follow last year’s reorg= מחדש of the Area 120 team, which saw the group moved into a new “Google Labs” division led by veteran Googler Clay Bavor. The incubator was then grouped alongside other forward-looking= צופה פני עתיד efforts at Google like its virtual= וירטואלי and augmented= מוּגבָּר reality developments and its cutting-edge= שיא הטכנולוגיה holographic= הולוגרפית videoconferencing= שיחת ועידה בוידאו project known as Project Starline. We understand Google Labs and Starline are not impacted for the time being.Google reorg moves AR, VR, Starline and Area 120 into new ‘Labs’ teamPichai= Teampichai announced in July that Google would slow its hiring= שְׂכִירָה and sharpen its focus, but the company had said larger layoffs= פיטורים were not planned= מתוכנן — it would still hire in engineering, technical and other critical roles. However, as part of its renewed= מְחוּדָשׁ emphasis on productivity,= פִּריוֹן the company acknowledges it may need to restructure= ארגון מחדש teams, deprecate= פילוק products or even, at times, eliminate roles.As for the Area 120 team members whose projects have now been discontinued,= הופסק Google’s recruiters= מגייסים will work to help them find new roles, though placement= מיקום is not a given in situations like these.Google has north of 174,000 employees. Area 120 had over 170 employees at the beginning of the year but is now under 100, one source said. Google told us these figures are not accurate, however.Editor’s note: The article was updated= מְעוּדכָּן moments after publication with Google’s comment.
